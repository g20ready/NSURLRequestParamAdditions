NSURLRequestParamAdditions
==========================

A category for NSURLRequest that adds the ability to generate a GET request with parameters from an NSDictionary.  The implementation is extremely similar to AFNetworking's AFHTTPClient, just broken out into its own category.  Many thanks to them!
